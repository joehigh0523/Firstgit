This demo code solution is used to demonstrate the usage of IQmeasure functions for different technologies.

1. You can build the IQmeasureTest.sln and an IQmeasureTest.exe will be generated in the \Bin folder.
2. You can open a command window and run the IQmeasureTest.exe. Some input arguments are needed for different technologies, e.g. -wifi-ag, -bt. Detailed information can be found in the _tmain() function.
