/*!< This method is used to setup the token ID with a particular token. 

\note Although the program allows you to set up more than one token, it currently supports the use of only one token. 

\n The value for this parameter is an enum value that is defined as follows: enum IQV_TOKEN_ENUM { IQV_TOKEN_NO_1, IQV_TOKEN_NO_2, IQV_TOKEN_CNT };

\c tokenID &mdash; This is a unique non-zero id, with a value that ranges  between 1 and 0xFFFFFFFF, and is used to distinguish between two test programs. Setting this parameter is optional. 

The program allows you to set up the two token IDs manually or automatically.

Setting the token ID manually &mdash; You can set the token ID value manually by assigning two different values that range between 1 and 0xFFFFFFFF for the tokens assigned to each of the two test programs.

\n Example: Set program in the first PC as follows: \c SetToken(IQV_TOKEN_NO_1, 0x1); set program in the second PC as follows: \c SetToken(IQV_TOKEN_NO_1, 0x2); 

Setting the token ID automatically &mdash; If you do not pass the token number parameter, the function automatically generates the token IDs.

\n Example: Set program in the first PC as follows: \c SetToken(IQV_TOKEN_NO_1); set program in the second PC as follows: \c SetToken(IQV_TOKEN_NO_1); 

\note The chances of these two programs generating the same token ID is very slim.

\note This method is used to retrieve a token from the test system when it becomes available. When the token is retrieved, it also retrieves the test system status into the program and therefore synchronizes the test system with the control software. Therefore, when the token is retrieved, the program and the test system are maintained in the same state.

\n \c timeout &mdash; A time indicating how long the program takes to attempt the retrieval of the token. This is specified in milliseconds. The default value is 0. However, if this value is set to the default value of 0, then the function waits until a token is retrieved; therefore, during this timeout period, the code is blocked and cannot run until it retrieves the token.
